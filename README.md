# SVM Classification Project README

## Introduction
This project focuses on enhancing the performance of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification tasks in the field of data science and machine learning. SVMs are powerful algorithms capable of separating data points into distinct classes by finding the optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
- Enhance the performance of SVMs through a systematic approach involving data normalization, hyperparameter tuning, and rigorous testing.
- Use an interesting dataset for the classification task (7 classes, imbalanced, outliers).
- Address issues such as inconsistencies, outliers, and variations in scale among features that can interfere with the performance of SVMs.
- Preprocess the dataset using normalization techniques to standardize the data and ensure equal contribution of all features.
- Construct an SVM model capable of handling linear and non-linear classification tasks by employing appropriate kernel functions.
- Tune hyperparameters, including the choice of kernel, regularization parameter (C), and kernel parameters (e.g., gamma for RBF kernel), using the grid search technique.
- Evaluate the SVM model using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its generalization performance on unseen data.
- Evaluate the influence of outliers and imbalance using different techniques

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Acquisition**: Obtain a relevant dataset for the classification task (Dry Beans).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize the dataset to address inconsistencies and variations in scale among features.
3. **Model Construction**: Construct an SVM model.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tune hyperparameters using the grid search technique to optimize model performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the SVM model using various evaluation metrics to assess its generalization performance on unseen data.
6. **Studying the influence of outliers and imbalance**: Implement different techniques to test how the existence of outliers and imbalance affects the performance of the SVM model.
